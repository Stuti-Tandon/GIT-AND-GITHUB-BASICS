# Git Basics – Concepts & Commands

## 1. Repository

A Git repository stores project files, version history, and configurations. It may be local or remote.

### Commands  
a. Initialize a new repository:
```bash
git init
```

b. Clone an existing remote repository:
```bash
git clone <remote-url>
```

## 2. Working Directory

The working directory contains files being modified. Changes here are not tracked until added to staging.

## 3. Staging Area (Index)

Intermediate area where changes are placed before committing.

### Commands  
a. Add all modified files:
```bash
git add .
```

b. Add a specific file:
```bash
git add <filename>
```

## 4. Commit

A commit stores a snapshot of staged changes into the repository history.

### Commands  
a. Commit staged changes:
```bash
git commit -m "commit message"
```

## 5. Branch

A branch represents a parallel line of development to isolate work.

### Commands  
a. List branches:
```bash
git branch
```

b. Create a new branch:
```bash
git branch <branch-name>
```

c. Switch to a branch:
```bash
git checkout <branch-name>
```

d. Create and switch to a new branch:
```bash
git checkout -b <branch-name>
```

## 6. Remote

A remote points to a repository hosted externally, commonly GitHub.

### Commands  
a. Show configured remotes:
```bash
git remote -v
```

b. Add a remote origin:
```bash
git remote add origin <ssh-or-https-url>
```

c. Remove a remote:
```bash
git remote remove <name>
```

## 7. SSH for Git

SSH allows secure authentication without frequent username/password entry.

### Commands  
a. Generate SSH key:
```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "<email>"
```

b. View public key:
```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

## 8. Push

Push uploads local commits to a remote repository.

### Commands  
a. First push (set upstream):
```bash
git push -u origin <branch-name>
```

b. Subsequent pushes:
```bash
git push
```

## 9. Pull

Pull fetches and merges remote changes into the local repository.

### Commands  
a. Pull changes:
```bash
git pull
```

## 10. Merge

Merge integrates changes from one branch into another.

### Commands  
a. Switch to target branch:
```bash
git checkout <branch-name>
```

b. Merge source into target:
```bash
git merge <source-branch>
```

## 11. Status

Shows working tree and staging information.

### Commands  
a. Show status:
```bash
git status
```

## 12. Log

Displays commit history.

### Commands  
a. Full log:
```bash
git log
```

b. Condensed log:
```bash
git log --oneline
```

## 13. .git Directory

`.git` is a hidden directory generated by Git containing metadata, object storage, configuration, and commit history. It should not be modified manually.

## 14. File Utilities (Shell Tools)

Utilities for creating and editing files during development.

### Commands  
a. Create an empty file:
```bash
touch <filename>
```

b. Edit using vi:
```bash
vi <filename>
```

Inside vi:
```
i      # insert mode
Esc
:wq    # write and quit
```

## 15. Example – Cloning a Public Repository

### Commands  
a. Clone using HTTPS:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/singh-ashok25/webserver.git
```
